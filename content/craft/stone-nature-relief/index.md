My introduction to stone carving! The design is inspired by [this relief](https://www.calveyrestoration.co.uk/), which I quickly found by searching for _Nature Relief_ on the spot.

Carved with mallet and chisels as part of a [CREA](www.crea.nl/) course tutored by [Mattis Nicklas](https://www.mattis-nicklas.com/).
