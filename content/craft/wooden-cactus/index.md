My first attempt at carving this cactus designed by [Werewolf Whittler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJMdAmR8EMw).

One of my go-to whittles when I don't have much time to carve and I want something nice and simple[^1]. Nowadays I go much deeper into the leaf crevices, it looks way better! Someday I will remember to take a picture of it...
