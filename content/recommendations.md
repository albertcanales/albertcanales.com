## Cool Old Websites

Whenever I find some random reference to an old blog, I like to explore the place. I love their personal touch. This is a list of my best findings, you can find more following their links.

- 2025/02/25: [Jason Grossman](https://xeny.net/). Found him while reading WikiWikiWeb. Love the autobiography and the programming languages recommendations.

- 2025/02/24: [WikiWikiWeb](https://wiki.c2.com/). The first ever Wiki created. Don't remember how I found it. I expected it to be _Wikipedia-ish_, but the tone is completely different (and I love it!).

- 2023/11/04: [Ramselehof](https://ramselehof.de). A website advertising a cozy farmhouse in Germany. Found it because of the tool [WikiBlame](http://wikipedia.ramselehof.de/wikiblame.php)

- 2023/02/27: [Beej's Website](https://beej.us/). Specifically the *Places to Visit* section. My favourite site is the Smokey Joe's Cafe one. Came across it because of [Moria](https://beej.us/moria/).

- 2023/01/13: [IEEE Token Ring](https://www.ieee802.org/5/www8025org/site.html). The personal touch on the smaller IEEE groups is really wholesome. Found it while ~~digressing from~~ studying for the Computer Networks subject.

- 2022/05/23: [Space Jam](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/). I believe this one is quite well-known. Don't remember how I found it.

- 2022/01/26: [Everything Linux](https://everythinglinux.org/frames.html). The first old personal website (and favourite one!) I found, the screenshots are amazing. Found it looking for some `rsync` information.

## Learning Resources

Some recommendations for books, talks and courses (along the notes I took of them) are also [available on my Github](https://github.com/albertcanales/learning-notes). Some of them may be in Catalan.
